Factory requires you to provide all details during initiliasiation.
When you are using the Builder, you can specify each item on demand.

23 Design Patterns:
1. Creational: creation of objects
2. Structural: Class structure such as inheritance and composition
3. Behaviorial: Interaction between objects

Creational:
1. Singleton - Restricts the initilization of a class to ensure that only one instance of the class can be created
2. Factory - Takes out the responsibility of instantiating an object from a class to a Factory class
3. Abstract Factory - Factory for factory classes
4. Builder - Creating an object step-by-step and returning it
5. Prototype - Forking an object into our requirements

Structural:
1. Adapter - Wrapper
2. Composite - Used to implement a part-whole hierarchy
3. Proxy - Provide a surrogate / placeholder for another object to control access it
4. Flyweight - Caching & Reusing object instances, used with immutable objects.
5. Facade - Creating a wrapper interfaces on top of existing interfaces
6. Bridge - Decouple interfaces from implementation (abstraction)
7. Decorator - Modify the functionality of an object during runtime
